# DeeplearningAI_AndrewNg
Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

# Warning
Finished by Jinkey, you can reference from my code，but please don't submit my code to coursera in order to get your own certification.

你可以参考我的代码，但请不要把我的代码提交到 Coursera 以获得你的证书。我的代码并非按照课程的代码风格和规范编写。

# My Environment
- Python 2.7
- scipy (0.13.0b1)
- numpy (1.13.3)
- matplotlib (2.0.2)
- h5py (2.7.1)

While In Python3，Int/Int may Float，but you may get zero in Python2. For example, 1/2=0 in Python2 while 1/2=0.5 in Python3
